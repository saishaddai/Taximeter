# Taximeter
Primary source of fare calculation: The taximeter is the primary source of calculating the fare, but taxi drivers are not obliged to use it for all fares. For longer fares or fares going out of the London metropolitan area, drivers may agree on a fixed fare with the passenger.
Pre-programmed fares: Taximeters contain tables of pre-programmed fares, specifying rates per unit of distance and time, which may vary according to location, local regulations, and calendar.
Calculation of fare: The taximeter calculates the fare by multiplying distance traveled by the rate per kilometer and time elapsed by the rate per minute, then adding these values together.
Display of fare: The taximeter displays the fare in real-time on a digital or analog display.
Printing a receipt (optional): Some taximeters can print a receipt showing the total amount, supplements applied, distance traveled, time elapsed, and other relevant trip details.
Legal requirement: It is illegal not to use the taximeter to calculate the fare. Taxi drivers must move the taximeter indicator to the recording position when the taxi is hired and return it to the non-recording position when the hiring terminates (Regulation 49(2) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations).
Consequences of non-compliance: Failure to use the taximeter to calculate the fare is an offence, punishable by a fine of $5,000 and imprisonment for 6 months (Regulation 57(3) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations).
